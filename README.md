# Smart Store Intelligence Pipeline with CCTV & Audio Data

This project aims to build an intelligent system that captures real-time CCTV footage and in-store audio, processes them into structured data, and loads the insights into a data warehouse for analytics. The system combines computer vision, speech recognition, and data engineering to enable smarter retail decisions like customer footfall tracking, sentiment analysis, and behavior patterns.

## üß† Project Summary

**Goal:** Transform unstructured video/audio data into structured insights using open-source tools.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time people counting from CCTV footage.
- In-store voice-to-text transcription and NLP for sentiment.
- Unified data pipeline to structure, clean, and store data.
- Load data into a warehouse (e.g., Snowflake, BigQuery, or PostgreSQL).
- Dashboard or analytics layer for reporting.

## üîß Architecture Overview

### 1. **Capture & Ingestion**
- **CCTV Cameras** ‚Üí Live video stream
- **Microphones** ‚Üí In-store audio capture
- **Edge Device / Stream Processor** ‚Üí e.g., Raspberry Pi or Jetson Nano
- **Apache Kafka** (Optional) ‚Üí For real-time data streams

### 2. **Processing Layer**

#### a. **Video Analysis**
- Tool: OpenCV + YOLOv8 or MediaPipe
- Process:
  - Frame extraction
  - Object detection (People count)
  - Timestamp tagging

#### b. **Speech Recognition**
- Tool: OpenAI Whisper / Vosk / Google Speech API
- Process:
  - Convert audio to text
  - Use NLP for extracting intent or sentiment

### 3. **Data Structuring & Enrichment**
- Tools: Python, Pandas, spaCy / NLTK
- Tasks:
  - Clean transcribed text
  - Normalize count data
  - Add store metadata (location, device ID, time window)

### 4. **Storage & Warehouse**
- Tools: PostgreSQL / Snowflake / BigQuery
- Method:
  - Load cleaned structured data via Airflow/DBT

### 5. **Reporting & Analytics**
- Tools: Power BI / Tableau / Superset / Streamlit
- Use Cases:
  - Daily footfall trends
  - Popular store hours
  - Voice sentiment changes

## üöÄ How to Run (Basic Flow)

1. Collect sample video/audio (or simulate with local files)
2. Run YOLO/Whisper to extract people count & text
3. Structure the data with timestamp + location
4. Load into PostgreSQL using a script or Airflow DAG
5. Visualize in a dashboard (e.g., Streamlit)

## üí° Future Extensions

- Add facial emotion detection
- Voice-based product feedback analysis
- RFID + Vision cross-validation
- Deploy on cloud with serverless (AWS Lambda, GCP Functions)
